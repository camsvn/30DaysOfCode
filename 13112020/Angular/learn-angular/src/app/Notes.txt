Angular Notes:

Data binding = communication

communication bw TS code of commponent (bussiness logic)
and the Template(what user see's)

+ diff types:
TS -> HTML 
    ● string interpolation {{title}}
        Any expresson which returns string
    ● property binding [property] = "data" 
            can binding t properties of HTML elements, Directives, Our own Component

HTML -> TS
    (eg: button click on template trigger code in TS)
    ● Event Binding (event) = "expression"

Two-way DataBinding: [(ngModel)] = "data"
    (react event and output something at the same time)
    TS ⇌ HTML


--------------

Directives: @Directive()
    are the instructions in DOM (components are such kind of instructions | components are Directives with template)
    
    Directives without template:
        (selector of a directive can be just like a selector of a component)
        but
        typically add directives with an attribute selector
        <p appTurnGreen>Recieve a green bacground!</p>

    Structural Directives: Changes the structure of DOM
        ● *ngIf - It either adds the element of doesn't add.
        ● *ngFor - repeat a node for each item in a list.
        ● *ngSwitch - a set of directives that switch among alternative views.

    Attribute Directives: Changes only the element they were paced on
        (NgModules such as the RouterModule and the FormsModule define their own attribute directives)
        ● ngStyle - add / remove set of HTML styles - expects a JS Object
        ● ngClass - add / remove set of css Class
        ● ngModel - two-way dataBinding to an HTML form element
