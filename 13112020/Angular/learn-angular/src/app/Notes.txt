Angular Notes:

Data binding = communication

communication bw TS code of commponent (bussiness logic)
and the Template(what user see's)

+ diff types:
TS -> HTML 
    ● string interpolation {{title}}
        Any expresson which returns string
    ● property binding [property] = "data" 
            can binding t properties of HTML elements, Directives, Our own Component

HTML -> TS
    (eg: button click on template trigger code in TS)
    ● Event Binding (event) = "expression"

Two-way DataBinding: [(ngModel)] = "data"
    (react event and output something at the same time)
    TS ⇌ HTML
