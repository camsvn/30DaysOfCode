WHY JS MODULE NOT WORKING IN BROWSER?

Unlike regular JavaScript files, 
modules are subject to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions. 
They have to be loaded from the same origin,
and cannot be loaded from the local filesystem. 

If you are loading them from the local file system, move them to a server
